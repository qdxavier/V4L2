Video_device struct is used for creating device node in /dev/*,the function is video_register_device.
the types of video device are VFL_TYPE_GRABBER:/dev/videoX for video input/output devices.
                              VFL_TYPE_BBI:/dev/vbiX
                              VFL_TYPE_RADIO:/dev/radioX
                              VFL_TYPE_SDR:/dev/swradioX
                              VFL_TYPE_TOUCH:/dev/v4l-touchX for touch sensors.
The function vide_device_alloc() is for allocate video_device object dynamically. 
The v4l2_file_operations is the subset of the file_operations in video_device struct.
Video device debugging, the log can be stored in /sys/class/video4linux/<devX> directory.
Video_unregister_device() is for removing the device node which is created by video_reigster_device.
Helper function, video_get_drvdata(vdev), video_set_drvdata(vdev), for set/get driver private data in the video_device struct.

The v4l2_subdev is initialized by v4l2_subdev_init(sd, &ops) function.
There are two methods for registering the sub device, one is synchronous mode, the other is async.
The initialization function is v4l2_device_register_subdev(v4l2_dev, sd);
The sub-device needs to notify its v4l2_device parent of an event by using v4l2_subdev_notify(sd, notification, arg);
A driver may contain several sub-devices that use an I2C bus, but also a subdev that is controlled through GPIO pins.
We have two methods for controlling sub-device, one is syscall for v4l2_subdev_ops, the other is controlled by userspace directly.
we can create device nodes named v4l2-subdevX for sub-devices in /dev to access directly.


V4L2 events 
The driver must use v4l2_fh to be able to support V4L2 events.
